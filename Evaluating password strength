#Password Strength Evaluation Project

This task demonstrates how different levels of password complexity affect password strength and resistance to common cyber attacks. It includes password creation, strength testing, and best practices for secure password generation.


#Objectives

1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.
2. Use combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and different lengths.
3. Test each password using a password strength checker.
4. Record feedback and strength scores.
5. Identify best practices for strong password creation.
6. Summarize tips learned from the evaluation.
7. Research common password attacks (e.g., brute force, dictionary attacks).
8. Understand how complexity improves password security.


#Password Samples & Complexity

| Password             | Upper | Lower | Num | Sym | Length | Strength |
|----------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:------:|:--------:|
| `catdog`             |   ❌   |  ✅   | ❌  | ❌  |   6    | Weak     |
| `CatDog123`          |   ✅   |  ✅   | ✅  | ❌  |   9    | Moderate |
| `Cat@123`            |   ✅   |  ✅   | ✅  | ✅  |   7    | Good     |
| `C@tD0g!2025`        |   ✅   |  ✅   | ✅  | ✅  |  12    | Strong   |
| `x7T!#uA9@qPz&Lk8`   |   ✅   |  ✅   | ✅  | ✅  |  17    | Very Strong |


# Password Strength Testing

Tested using: [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

#Feedback Summary:

- Short + simple passwords: Easily cracked within seconds
- Mixed characters and moderate length: Better but still crackable
- Long + complex passwords: Highly secure, resistant to brute-force

# Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12–16 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid common words, phrases, and **personal information
- Use random combinations
- Use a password manager to generate/store strong passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

#Tips learned from the evaluation

Longer = stronger
Don't reuse passwords
Avoid personal info (names, birthdays)
Use random strings or passphrases (e.g., Blue$Monkey!Sky92)
Change passwords periodically.
Use MFA (multi-factor authentication) where possible

#Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force    | Tries all possible character combinations                                   |
| Dictionary      | Tries common words and leaked passwords                                     |
| Phishing        | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake login pages or emails        |
| Credential Stuffing | Uses stolen credentials from other breaches to gain access to new accounts |

#Password Complexity & Security Summary

- Short/simple passwords are vulnerable to fast, automated attacks.
- Password length + variety greatly improves security.
- Complex passwords are computationally expensive to crack.
- Using MFA and password managers further enhances protection.
